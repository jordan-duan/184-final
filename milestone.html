		<h2>Updates</h2>

		<p>
            After two weeks, we have successfully begun the implementation of the two major parts of our project: shaders and 
            spheres. More specifically, we implemented shaders using Fabric 1.20.2, a Minecraft mod loader. Fabric allowed us 
            to easily add vertex, fragment, and GLSL files directly into Minecraft's native shaders folder. This resulted in 
            us adding several of our milestone goals right away, including sky rendering with fog, stars, and clouds, shadow 
            mapping with distortion, water rendering, physically-based rendering, reflection and ray marching, and deferred 
            shading. We are planning to make a GUI or change keybinds to toggle different shaders with switch case functions 
            (for example, 0=ambient, 1=diffusion, 2=specular, 3=blinn phong). We are also trying to tackle some edge cases 
            of how light from torches react to sunlight and entity shadows, and shadow self collisions. 
		</p>

        <p>
            In preparation for integrating the LibBulletJTime physics engine, we explored working with either blocks or mobs, 
            focusing on spherical modeling for both. Our first test used these .obj renderings of spheres as block models, 
            allowing us to use native Minecraft gravity support, such as that seen in gravel. To enable movement and collision 
            detection, our second test modeled spheres as entities using .java modeling to place unit cubes along a radius 
            with the sphere equation. Building on top of entities allows for better mobility but requires new animations to 
            simulate rolling.
        </p>

        <p>
            Relative to our original plan, we're roughly on schedule. We expected the shaders to be significantly more 
            complicated, so the majority of our later milestones have already been completed. For the shading-based milestones 
            that we haven't completed yet, we have a strong foundational understanding of how to implement shaders, meaning 
            future development will hopefully go smoothly. In contrast, implementation of spheres was slightly more difficult 
            than expected. While we were able to add them into Minecraft, we were left with a design choice: choosing between 
            making the sphere a block or an entity. After we finish testing the pros and cons of each choice, we expect the 
            rest of development to proceed smoothly.
        </p>
