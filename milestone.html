		<h2>Updates</h2>

		<p>
            After two weeks, we have successfully begun the implementation of the two major parts of our project: shaders and 
            spheres. More specifically, we implemented shaders using Fabric 1.20.2, a Minecraft mod loader. Fabric allowed us 
            to easily add vertex, fragment, and GLSL files directly into Minecraft's native shaders folder. This resulted in 
            us adding several of our milestone goals right away, including sky rendering with fog, stars, and clouds, shadow 
            mapping with distortion, water rendering, physically-based rendering, reflection and ray marching, and deferred 
            shading. We are planning to make a GUI or change keybinds to toggle different shaders with switch case functions 
            (for example, 0=ambient, 1=diffusion, 2=specular, 3= blinn phong). We are also trying to tackle some edge cases 
            of how light from torches react to sunlight and entity shadows, and shadow self collisions. 
		</p>

        <p>
            Relative to our original plan, we're roughly on schedule. We expected the shaders to be significantly more 
            complicated, so the majority of our later milestones have already been completed. For the shading-based milestones 
            that we haven't completed yet, we have a strong foundational understanding of how to implement shaders, meaning 
            future development will hopefully go smoothly. In contrast, implementation of spheres was slightly more difficult 
            than expected. While we were able to add them into Minecraft, we were left with a design choice: choosing between 
            making the sphere a block or an entity. After we finish testing the pros and cons of each choice, we expect the 
            rest of development to proceed smoothly.
        </p>

		<h2>Schedule</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Test sphere implementation with block vs. entity</li>
            <li>Test basic object simulations and collisions in voxel map</li>
            <li>Continue to add and experiment with new shaders</li>
            <li>Integration testing</li>
		</ul>

		<p><i>Week 4 (Unchanged)</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Polish demo scene</li>
			<li>Add final UI improvements of GUI and/or in-game command tool</li>
			<li>Include fun shading options and/or different objects/ragdoll objects</li>
